# VHDL (Complex Digital Systems)

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **complex digital systems** implemented in **VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) programming**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Computer Architecture** course during my [Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.dieei.unict.it/corsi/l-8-inf) at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it).

## üåç Context

This repository contains a series of exercises focused on VHDL, a hardware description language used for modeling and simulating digital systems. <br>
VHDL is essential for designing and verifying digital circuits at various abstraction levels, from the behavioral to the structural level.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Digital Design Fundamentals**: Develop a solid understanding of digital design principles using VHDL.
- **Hardware Description and Simulation**: Gain hands-on experience in describing digital hardware and simulating its behavior using VHDL.
- **Practical Circuit Design**: Apply VHDL to design and implement various digital circuits, enhancing problem-solving and design skills.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Basic Constructs**: Exercises on basic VHDL constructs, including signals, variables, processes, and components.
- **Sequential and Concurrent Statements**: Exercises covering sequential and concurrent statements, conditionals, loops, and signal assignment.
- **Entity-Architecture Modeling**: Exercises on designing entities and architectures, including combinational and sequential circuits.
- **Complex Digital Systems**: Exercises on designing more complex digital systems, such as state machines, arithmetic circuits, and memory units.
